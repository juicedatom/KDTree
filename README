Dependencies
------------

This code has two dependencies,
    CppUnit,
    Boost C++ libraries

if you are using apt then you can simply run
    sudo apt-get install libcppunit-dev libboost-all-dev

-----------
building
-----------
It's pretty simple, just run "make"
and the Makefile should do its thing.

-----------
running
-----------
The build should generate an executable "TreeTest"
which will run the unit tests for the tree.
They aren't very extensive but just enough testing
to show the tree works
